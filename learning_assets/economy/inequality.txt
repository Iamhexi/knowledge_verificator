Addressing inequality leads to a more dynamic and resilient economy.
Increased equity means that everyone has a chance to develop their skills efficiently and deploy their talents most effectively.
Conversely, when people are unable to reach their full productivity because of discrimination or systemic inequality, the overall economy suffers.

Looking at these effects across the entire economy shows that the economic costs of inequity are quite high.
For example, a study in Econometrica analyzes the changes in demographics of high-skilled occupations between 1960 and 2010.
The authors estimate that during this period, improved job opportunities and talent allocation for women and communities of color drove up to 40 percent of the growth in aggregate U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) per person.
