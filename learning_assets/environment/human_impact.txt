Human impact on the environment (or anthropogenic environmental impact) refers to changes to biophysical environments
and to ecosystems, biodiversity, and natural resources caused directly or indirectly by humans.
Modifying the environment to fit the needs of society (as in the built environment) is causing severe effects including
global warming, environmental degradation (such as ocean acidification), mass extinction and biodiversity loss,
ecological crisis, and ecological collapse.

Some human activities that cause damage (either directly or indirectly) to the environment on a global scale include
population growth, neoliberal economic policies and rapid economic growth, overconsumption, overexploitation, pollution,
and deforestation.
Some of the problems, including global warming and biodiversity loss,
have been proposed as representing catastrophic risks to the survival of the human species.
