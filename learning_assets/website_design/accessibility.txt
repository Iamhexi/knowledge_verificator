No automated website evaluation tool can solve for total digital accessibility.
That said, automated scanning and testing tools are cost-effective, easy to use,
and can quickly catch a broad range of issues across websites of all sizes with all sorts of content.
Bottom line—keep in mind that if all you use is an automated scanning tool,
75 percent or more of the WCAG success criteria aren’t even being tested.
No artificial intelligence has been able to replicate the human mind in testing accessibility.
The only way to get a true and comprehensive picture of the accessibility of your digital assets
is to include human testing performed by people with a variety of disabilities using different assistive technologies.
