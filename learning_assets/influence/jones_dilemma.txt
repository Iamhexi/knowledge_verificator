Deception becomes more difficult as the number of channels of information available to the
victim increases. However, within limits, the greater the number of controlled channels, the
greater the likelihood of the deception being believed.
This maxim is called Jones' Dilemma because it has been best articulated by Professor R. V.
Jones, one of the key figures in British scientific intelligence during World War II.
